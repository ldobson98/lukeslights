			<p class="intro">Our work started to pay off during the 2012 season.  We landed our first newspaper article and TV interview.
			This year's major new addition was our tree of lights, which contains special RGB lights, which allow the tree to turn several million different colors!
			It was also the first year for our Food Drive.  We set a goal of 300 pounds, and ended with 931!  We had around 7,500 lights in our third year.</p>
			<p class="intro">Below our videos appear in chronological order. <b>NOTE:</b> When the videos were recorded, only 5 of the 7 songs were finished.  We are sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
