	<p>Hi, I’m Luke Dobson.  I’m the creator behind Luke’s Lights, which has been around since 2010.  The idea for the show began in 2009, when I wanted to bring the family’s holiday decorations to the next level.  
	After one year of planning, constructing, and sequencing, Luke’s Lights opened for the first year in 2010.  To see what we have added over the years, click <a href="videos/videos.html">HERE</a> to go to our ‘Archives’ page.</p>
	<p>In 2012, we wanted to give back to the community.  We decided that the best way to do this would be to set up a food drive where people can donate non-perishable food items for the St. Joseph’s Food Pantry.  
	By doing this, we made the display more unique.  Below, you can see the table of all the donations we’ve gotten, and how it corresponds with the year.</p>
