	<p>Hi, I’m Luke Dobson.  I’m the creator behind Luke’s Lights, a computerized, residential light show that began in 2010.  The idea for the show began in 2009, when I wanted to bring the family’s holiday decorations to the next level.  
	After one year of planning, constructing, and sequencing, Luke’s Lights opened for the first year in 2010.  To see what we have added over the years, check out our <a href="videos/videos.html">archives</a>.</p>
	<p>Luke's Lights has more than 8,500 lights, the majority of which are energy-efficient LEDs. All of our lights are synchronized to music over our own radio station, allowing viewers to listen to the show from their cars. </p>
	<p>In 2012, we wanted to give back to the community.  From 2012-2019, we decided that the best way to do this would be to set up a food drive where people can donate non-perishable food items for the St. Joseph’s Food Pantry.  Below you can see a yearly breadown of the more than 24,000 pounds of food we've collected so far.  For 2020, we are piloting Pay It Forward, a contactless way to give back to the community.</p>
